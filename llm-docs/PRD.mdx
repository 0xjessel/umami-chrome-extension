# Product Requirements Document: Umami Analytics Chrome Extension

## Overview
The Umami Analytics Chrome Extension provides website owners with real-time analytics data directly in their browser. This extension integrates with existing Umami Analytics installations to display key metrics without requiring users to navigate to the Umami dashboard.

## Problem Statement
Website owners who use Umami Analytics need to frequently check their analytics dashboard to monitor traffic metrics. This creates friction and interrupts their workflow when they want to quickly check current site performance.

## Solution
A Chrome extension that displays real-time analytics data from Umami directly in the browser toolbar, allowing users to monitor key metrics without switching contexts.

## Target Users
- Website owners and administrators who already use Umami Analytics
- Content creators who want to monitor the performance of their content in real-time
- Marketing professionals tracking campaign performance

## Key Features

### 1. Live Counter Display
- A simple, unobtrusive icon in the Chrome toolbar
- Numerical counter displayed as a bubble/badge on the icon
- Counter updates at configurable intervals

### 2. Metric Options
Users can choose to display one of the following metrics:
- Number of active users on the site in real-time
- Number of page views for a specific page
- Number of total visitors for the current day

### 3. Configuration Panel
- Umami server URL
- Authentication credentials (username/password or API key)
- Website ID selection
- Specific page URL for page view tracking (optional)
- Update frequency (polling interval)
- Display metric selection

### 4. Additional Features
- Tooltip with additional context when hovering over the counter
- Option to click the icon to open a small popup with more detailed metrics
- Ability to quickly navigate to the full Umami dashboard

## Technical Requirements

### Umami API Integration
- The extension must connect to the Umami API to fetch real-time data using the following endpoints:
  - `/api/websites/:websiteId/active` - To get the number of active users on the website (within the last 5 minutes)
  - `/api/websites/:websiteId/stats` - To get daily visitor and visit counts
- Authentication methods:
  - For self-hosted Umami: Username/password authentication
  - For Umami Cloud: API key authentication
- Proper error handling for API failures including rate limits and network issues

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient polling to minimize resource usage and API rate limits
- Configurable polling frequency (minimum: 30 seconds, recommended: 60 seconds)
- Option to pause polling when not actively needed
- Caching of API responses to reduce unnecessary requests
- Intelligent refresh strategy based on tab activity state

### Security Requirements
- Secure storage of authentication credentials using Chrome's Storage API with encryption
- No tracking or collection of user data beyond what's needed for functionality
- All API requests must use HTTPS
- Implementation of proper CORS handling
- Compliance with Chrome Web Store policies
- Clear privacy policy explaining data handling practices

1. User installs the extension
2. First-time setup wizard prompts for:
