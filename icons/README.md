# Extension Icons

The Umami logo SVG is provided in `logo.svg`. To use this extension, you'll need to convert it to PNG files at the following sizes:
- 16x16 as `icon16.png`
- 32x32 as `icon32.png`
- 48x48 as `icon48.png`
- 128x128 as `icon128.png`

You can convert the SVG to PNG using various tools:
1. ImageMagick: `convert -background none -size 48x48 logo.svg icon48.png`
2. Online SVG to PNG converters
3. Figma, Sketch, or other design tools

Make sure to generate all four sizes and place them in this directory.
